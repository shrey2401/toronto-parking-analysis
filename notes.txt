Set up project folder

Made folders: data/, scripts/, visuals/

Put CSV files in data/

Set up Python environment

Created a virtual environment venv

Installed needed libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, mysql-connector-python

Load the CSV file

Read one month of parking ticket data into Python using pandas.read_csv()

Checked the dataset with df.info() and df.head()

Clean the data

Converted date_of_infraction to a proper date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

Converted time_of_infraction to "HH:MM"

Combined all location columns (location1–4) into one column full_location

Dropped columns not needed for analysis: tag_number_masked, location1–4, province

Preview cleaned data

Looked at first few rows to make sure it looks correct

Save cleaned dataset

Exported the cleaned data as parking_tickets_cleaned.csv in the data/ folder

This cleaned CSV is ready for analysis, dashboard, or MySQL upload
Counted how many times each infraction_description appears

Selected the top 10 most frequent violations

Plotted a horizontal bar chart using Seaborn/Matplotlib

Saved chart as top_violations.png in visuals/ folder

Extracted street names from full location text using regex

Counted number of tickets per street

Visualized top 10 most ticketed streets

Saved chart as top_streets.png

What db_upload.py does:
  - Creates MySQL database: toronto_parking_db
  - Creates table: parking_tickets (with columns for date, infraction, fine, location, etc.)
  - Reads parking_tickets_cleaned.csv from data/ folder
  - Uploads all 142,881 records into MySQL database
  - Verifies upload by checking row count and showing sample rows

How it works:
  Step 1: create_database() → Creates empty warehouse (database)
  Step 2: create_table() → Creates labeled shelves (table structure)
  Step 3: upload_data() → Moves all data from CSV into MySQL
  Step 4: verify_upload() → Confirms all 142,881 records arrived correctly

Result: ✅ 142,881 records successfully uploaded to MySQL database
STEP 9: Create SQL Query Bridge (python_sql_queries.py)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What python_sql_queries.py does:
  - Creates a TorontoParkingDB class (helper toolbox)
  - Connects to MySQL database
  - Has pre-built query methods ready to use

Pre-built Methods:
  - get_summary_stats() → Overall statistics
  - get_top_infractions(limit) → Most common violations
  - get_by_ward() → Grouped by ward (EMPTY - no ward data)
  - get_by_date() → Grouped by date
  - get_fine_distribution() → Fine ranges ($50, $100, etc.)

How it works:
  Instead of writing connection code every time, you just call:
  db = TorontoParkingDB(password='your_password')
  db.connect()
  df = db.get_top_infractions(10)
  
Result: ✅ Easy way to query database from Python


STEP 10: Write Raw SQL Queries (sql_analysis.sql)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Created 10 SQL queries in sql_analysis.sql:
  1. Basic database check
  2. Summary statistics
  3. Top 15 infraction types
  4. Tickets by ward (EMPTY - no ward data)
  5. Monthly trend analysis
  6. Fine amount distribution
  7. Street analysis (EMPTY - no street data)
  8. Day of week analysis
  9. Geospatial summary (EMPTY - no coordinates)
  10. Data quality check

How to use:
  - Open MySQL Workbench
  - Copy any query from sql_analysis.sql
  - Run it to see results

Data Quality Found:
  - 142,881 total records ✓
  - All have dates ✓
  - All have fines ✓
  - NO ward data ✗
  - NO street names ✗
  - NO coordinates ✗


STEP 11: Advanced Analysis & Charts (advanced_analysis.py)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Created 5 charts from database queries:

Chart 1: Top 15 Infraction Types (Horizontal Bar)
  - Shows most common parking violations
  - PARK ON PRIVATE PROPERTY: 26,965 tickets (most common)

Chart 2: Fine Distribution (Pie Chart)
  - Shows how many tickets in each price range
  - Example: 45% are Under $50, 30% are $50-$100, etc.

Chart 3: Monthly Trend (Line Chart)
  - Shows how many tickets per month
  - Helps identify busy/slow months

Chart 4: Average Fine by Infraction (Horizontal Bar)
  - Shows which violations have highest average fines
  - Example: STOP violations are $190, PARK violations are $45

Chart 5: Day of Week (Bar Chart)
  - Shows which days have most tickets
  - Example: Monday vs Friday comparison

Summary Statistics:
  - Total tickets: 142,881
  - Unique dates: 31 (one month of data)
  - Average fine: $77.55
  - Min fine: $0
  - Max fine: $500

Output:
  - 5 PNG files in visuals/ folder
  - summary_statistics.txt in sql_outputs/ folder
```
